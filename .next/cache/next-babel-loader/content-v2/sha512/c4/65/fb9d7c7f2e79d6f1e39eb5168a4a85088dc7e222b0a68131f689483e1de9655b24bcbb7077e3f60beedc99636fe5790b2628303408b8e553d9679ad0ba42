Devices attached to the network are evaluated to detect technical vulnerabilities. Ethical Hacking is accomplished by performing scheduled and selective probes of the network\\u2019s communication services, operating systems, key applications, and network equipment in search of those vulnerabilities. Our specialists analyze the vulnerability conditions and provide a detailed report including corrective actions. A Vulnerability Assessment is a method of evaluating the security posture of a system through the identification of vulnerabilities that have the potential for negative impact. Vulnerabilities are then documented and given risk ratings based on an industry-standard risk rating system. This service does not involve exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities, as is present with Penetration Testing. The overall goal of a Vulnerability Assessment is to identify vulnerabilities, document them, apply risk ratings and formally document the results in a report combined with appropriate recommendations for remediation.

ISMS also include a comprehensive approach in assessing risks on one hand, and identifying opportunities for improvement. Such opportunities take the shape of designing, documenting, implementing, measuring , auditing and continuously improving information security posture. Improvement can take place both due to proactive process such as risk assessment, and reactive such as Incidents. In simple words, a proactive approach to preventing and reacting to information related incidents. The ability to be aware of what is our present weakness and our ability to know how we will react– is in essence a true impact of a formal ISMS. On the contrary not being aware of any aspect of the any part of the system and its security relevance, or the approach that we will take in case of a failure – therefore demonstrates the absence of ISMS.</p>\r\n                                                            <h3>WHAT IS ASHAL TECH APPROACH TO SUCCESSFUL ISMS – ISO 27001 CONSULTING/CERTIFICATION?</h3>\r\n                                                            <p>We bring our world-class experience in delivery ISMS ISO 27001 implementation leading to successful certification.</p>\r\n                                                            <p><strong>Phase I</strong> – Understanding the business context and relevance of information security is the starting point of ISO 27001 2013 implementation analysis.</p>\r\n                                                            <p><strong>Phase II</strong> – Detail risk assessment/Gap analysis including information asset identification, it security risk assessment including threats, impacts, vulnerabilities and probabilities resulting in identification of risks, and gaps.

Vulnerability assessment analyses the security weaknesses in overall network and suggests the level up to which a network can be attacked by a malicious intruder. Accordingly a detailed report is generated and mitigation strategies are planned. <b>Overview</b> Vulnerability Assessment enables clients to quickly identify, assess and remedy security holes. Devices attached to the network are evaluated to detect technical vulnerabilities. Ethical Hacking is accomplished by performing scheduled and selective probes of the network’s communication services, operating systems, key applications, and network equipment in search of those vulnerabilities. Our specialists analyze the vulnerability conditions and provide a detailed report including corrective actions. A Vulnerability Assessment is a method of evaluating the security posture of a system through the identification of vulnerabilities that have the potential for negative impact. Vulnerabilities are then documented and given risk ratings based on an industry-standard risk rating system. This service does not involve exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities, as is present with Penetration Testing. The overall goal of a Vulnerability Assessment is to identify vulnerabilities, document them, apply risk ratings and formally document the results in a report combined with appropriate recommendations for remediation. Vulnerability Assessment is a battle simulation to determine what vulnerabilities have not been addressed in your network. By locating vulnerabilities before the bad guys do, Penetration Testing will increase the level of confidence of the company’s security measures.

Our comprehensive methodology ensures that our clients’ vulnerabilities are represented by their true real-world likelihood and potential impact to their business. The methodology is founded upon industry-standard frameworks, such as: OSSTMM, ISSAF, OWASP, WASC and NIST Special Publication 800 Series guidelines.</p>\r\n                                                            <h4>Methodology</h4>\r\n                                                            <p>System/service discovery consists of compiling a complete list of all accessible systems and their respective services with the ultimate goal of obtaining as much information about the assets as possible. Commonly, this includes: domain foot printing, live host detection, service enumeration, rogue system/service detection, product-specific vulnerability detection, and operating system and application fingerprinting. With the information collected from the discovery phase, security testing transitions to identifying vulnerabilities in internal and externally facing systems and applications using automated scans and manual testing techniques. Ashaltech begins the vulnerability identification process with a combination of commercial and open source vulnerability scanners. Automated scans are good at identifying known and common vulnerabilities, however, automated scans are not good at detecting complex security issues or validating the findings reported. For this reason, automated scans represent only a small facet of the overall security assessment with the majority of vulnerability testing focused on manual testing and verification. Ashaltech has adopted an industry-standard approach to assigning risk ratings to vulnerabilities. This approach is used in all our assessments and provides our clients with consistent risk ratings that take into account a number of factors ranging from: Skill Level, Motive, Ease of Exploit, Loss of Integrity, Loss of Availability to Loss in Privacy and Reputational Damage.</p>\r\n                                                            <h4>Phase 1 – Passive Data Collection</h4>\r\n                                                            <p>The initial phase of any security review involves extensive data collection and penetration studies are no exception.

Our process examines for security risk such as:</p>\r\n                                                            <ul className=\"border-bottom mb-2 pb-2\">\r\n                                                                <li><i className=\"bx bx-bullseye\"></i> Encryption / SSL Testing</li>\r\n                                                                <li><i className=\"bx bx-bullseye\"></i> HTML Code & Form Vulnerabilities</li>\r\n                                                                <li><i className=\"bx bx-bullseye\"></i> Hidden Field Manipulation</li>\r\n                                                                <li><i className=\"bx bx-bullseye\"></i> Parameter Tampering</li>\r\n                                                                <li><i className=\"bx bx-bullseye\"></i> Cookie Poisoning</li>\r\n                                                                <li><i className=\"bx bx-bullseye\"></i> Executable code testing such as buffer overflows and IIS weaknesses</li>\r\n                                                            </ul>\r\n                                                            <h4>Phase 3 – Aggressive Penetration</h4>\r\n                                                            <p>Finally, the assessment escalates to Aggressive Penetration where attempts are made to fully compromise the web infrastructures.

Being closely related concerns, governance, risk and compliance activities are increasingly being integrated and aligned to some extent in order to avoid conflicts, wasteful overlaps and gaps. While interpreted differently in various organizations, GRC typically encompasses activities such as corporate governance, enterprise risk management (ERM) and corporate compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>\r\n                                                        <h5>Governance</h5>\r\n                                                        <p>It describes the overall management approach through which senior executives direct and control the entire organization, using a combination of management information and hierarchical management control structures. Governance activities ensure that critical management information reaching the executive team is sufficiently complete, accurate and timely to enable appropriate management decision making, and provide the control mechanisms to ensure that strategies, directions and instructions from management are carried out systematically and effectively.</p>\r\n                                                        <h5>Risk management</h5>\r\n                                                        <p>It is a set of processes through which management identifies, analyses, and where necessary responds appropriately to risks that might adversely affect realization of the organization’s business objectives. The response to risks typically depends on their perceived gravity, and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting or transferring them to a third party. Whereas organizations routinely manage a wide range of risks (e.g. technological risks, commercial/financial risks, information security risks etc.), external legal and regulatory compliance risks are arguably the key issue in GRC.</p>\r\n                                                        <h5>Compliance</h5>\r\n                                                        <p>At an organizational level, it is achieved through management processes which identify the applicable requirements (defined for example in laws, regulations, contracts, strategies and policies), assess the state of compliance, assess the risks and potential costs of non-compliance against the projected expenses to achieve compliance, and hence prioritize, fund and initiate any corrective actions deemed necessary.</p>\r\n                                                        <div className=\"image\">\r\n                                                            <img src=\"/img/services/Governance-Risk-and-Compliance1.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\r\n                                                        </div> \r\n                                                        <p>The GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) program has been in providing advisory and implementation services to enable our customers to meet their governance, risk management, and compliance objectives. We provide these services to a wide variety of industry verticals, including Banking, Financial Services, Insurance, Government Sector, Hospitality, Education etc. The increasing demand for stringent corporate governance, management accountability, regulatory and compliance requirements have been presenting increasing challenges to the organizations. These have led to urgent and continuing requirement of integrated processes and practices covering governance, risk and compliance (GRC).</p>\r\n                                                        <p>Furthermore, the extensive and growing dependence of business processes on IT has led to increased risks and vulnerabilities.
